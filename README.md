# Guess the number

This project is a simple game. The aim is to correctly guess a secret number.

I engaged in this project because I wanted to test my skills with JavaScript. I previously created a similar game in Python.

**You can try this game on [GitHubPages]().**

## Functions

You can select your preferred difficulty with the select menu on top:

* *Easy*: the range is inbetween 1 and 25.

* *Medium*: the range is inbetween 1 and 50.

* *Hard*: the range is inbetween 1 and 100.

Changing the difficulty automatically restarts the game.

A counter lets you know how many attempts you have left.

When the game is over, you can press the **Play again** button to restart the game.


## Features

While on the input, the only allowed keys are: 

* Numbers
* Left and right arrow
* Backspace

Both the **Try** button and the Enter key work the same way.
